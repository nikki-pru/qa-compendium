Welcome to Liferay QA!
======================

  Your journey here begins now. Along the way, there will be highs and there will be lows but we're all on this journey together. The things you read in this guide, read carefully and read well. Familiarize yourself with everything here -- this guide will be your friend in the upcoming weeks.

  As a member of the QA team, you will have the opportunity to take on many new challenges. We ask you to:

  * **Be independent;**
  * **Use Google;**
  * **Ask questions; and**
  * **Look for ways to be proactively engaged and to solve problems**.

  Knowing when to ask for help is huge. As a general rule of thumb, if you’re working hard on something for a solid 30 minutes straight and you are not making any progress - consider at that point to ask questions or escalate to your trainer or lead. If you run into an issue that you are completely stuck with (or if your computer breaks in the middle of the task) - do NOT wait until the end of the day to let your trainer or lead know. Notify someone as soon as possible if something like this happens.

  Training may feel overwhelming, initially, but it will start to make sense over time. Trust your trainers and your team and don’t shy away from asking questions. Every question is significant, and you will have many, so do not be afraid to ask them.
