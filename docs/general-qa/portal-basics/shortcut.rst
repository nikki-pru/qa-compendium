Setting up a clean environment for testing can be tedious especially when we have to do it every day, sometimes multiple times a day. To alleviate this, there is a script we can use to run these basic tasks. Please take a moment to look over this `script`_, make a copy of it locally and try running a few commands using the script. As a quick exercise, do the following:

1. On MySQL prompt, drop the lportal database.
2. On Terminal, use the script to createdb, with database name lportal.
3. On MySQL run the command to show all the databases and verify that lportal has been created.

As you get familiar with what you need on the daily, feel free to edit this `script`_ to your needs. If you have scripted something out that you know will be helpful to other testers, you may also send in edits to the script by sending a pull request [pending link to Git Training here].
